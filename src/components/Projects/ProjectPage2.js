            <p>I played a central role in Bee Trialâ€™s development, taking charge of <b className="purple">illustration</b>,
                <b className="purple">character, level, and interface design</b>, as well as <b className="purple">marketing and event planning strategies</b>.
                My contributions ensured a cohesive and engaging visual experience throughout the video game.</p>
            <p>Initially I contributed to <b className="purple">programming the weapons</b>, but then changed to taking charge of the game's aesthetic
                choices. This included <b className="purple">designing</b> the game's environment to match the story, as well as designing the main character, allies, and enemies accordingly.</p>
            <p> I also designed the remaining assets such as weapons and powerups, as well as the user interfaces
                and skins for the player.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from this, I also was in charge of managing the game's website and curate the game stand experience
                for the game fair by designing posters, stickers and costumes.
